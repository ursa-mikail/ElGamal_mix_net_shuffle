‚úÖ Each of the N mix servers or clients (e.g. 5 nodes) would:
1. Generate its own ElGamal key pair (c‚Çñ, C‚Çñ = c‚Çñ¬∑G)
2. Contribute to a joint public key:
- Use techniques like key aggregation, threshold encryption, or layered encryption.

3. Encrypt the message (e.g. 0‚Äì51) multiple times ‚Äî each layer encrypted under a different node's public key (like onion encryption).

4. Each node in turn:
- Shuffles the ciphertexts.
- Re-randomizes the ciphertexts to prevent linkability.
- Produces a ZK proof that the shuffle is valid (i.e. permuted + re-randomized but same messages).
- Passes it to the next node.

5. The final node‚Äôs shuffle is decrypted in reverse order by each node revealing its private key or partial decryption.

### üîê Why Use N Key Pairs?

| Reason                | Why it matters                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Distributed trust** | No single party holds all decryption power |
| **Privacy**           | No party knows the full permutation        |
| **Accountability**    | Each mixer proves it did a valid shuffle   |
| **Security**          | Eliminates single-point-of-failure         |

### üß© ElGamal Mixnet with Multiple Keys (High-level sketch):

```
1. Node A: Encrypt under PK‚ÇÅ, shuffle‚ÇÅ, proof‚ÇÅ
2. Node B: Encrypt (or re-randomize) under PK‚ÇÇ, shuffle‚ÇÇ, proof‚ÇÇ
3. ...
n. Node N: Final shuffleN, proofN

Then:
Decryption‚ÇÅ ‚Üí Decryption‚ÇÇ ‚Üí ... ‚Üí DecryptionN (full plaintext recovered)
